## About this dataset

This dataset contains detailed information on the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. It includes information on age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure values, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, smoking habits and alcohol consumption of over 70 thousand individuals. Additionally it outlines if the person is active or not and if he or she has any cardiovascular diseases. This dataset provides a great resource for researchers to apply modern machine learning techniques to explore the potential relations between risk factors and cardiovascular disease that can ultimately lead to improved understanding of this serious health issue and design better preventive measures
