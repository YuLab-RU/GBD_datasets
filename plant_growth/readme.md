# Greenhouse Plant Growth


## About this dataset

This dataset contains physiological and morphological measurements of plants collected in an experimental study comparing IoT-based greenhouse systems with traditional greenhouses. It includes 30,000 samples with 14 columns representing growth metrics, chlorophyll levels, biomass data, and classification labels. The data was collected as part of a master’s thesis project at Tikrit University, aiming to analyze the effects of technology-driven agriculture.

## Data dictionary

Column name - Description

ACHP - Average chlorophyll content per plant, an indicator of photosynthetic activity.\
PHR - Plant height rate – measures the vertical growth over time.\
AWWGV - Average wet weight of vegetative growth – total fresh weight of the above-ground parts.\
ALAP - Average leaf area per plant – surface area of leaves which impacts photosynthesis.\
ANPL - Average number of leaves per plant – indicates plant maturity and foliage density.\
ARD - Average root diameter – thickness of roots, relevant to nutrient uptake.\
ADWR - Average dry weight of roots – total root biomass after drying.\
PDMVG - Percentage of dry matter in vegetative growth – measures solid content in shoots.\
ARL - Average root length – indicates root development and depth.\
AWWR - Average wet weight of roots – total fresh root weight.\
ADWV - Average dry weight of vegetative parts – dried mass of above-ground plant parts.\
PDMRG - Percentage of dry matter in root growth – solid content of the root system.\
Class - Categorical label indicating the experimental group: SA, SB, SC (Traditional Greenhouse); TA, TB, TC (IoT-based Greenhouse).
