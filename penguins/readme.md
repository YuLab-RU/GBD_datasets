# Penguins dataset 

The Palmer Penguins data was originally published in [Gorman et al. (2014)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0090081). 

> Sexual segregation in vertebrate foraging niche is often associated with sexual size dimorphism (SSD), i.e., ecological sexual dimorphism. Although foraging behavior of male and female seabirds can vary markedly, differences in isotopic (carbon, δ13C and nitrogen, δ15N) foraging niche are generally more pronounced within sexually dimorphic species and during phases when competition for food is greater. We examined ecological sexual dimorphism among sympatric nesting *Pygoscelis* penguins asking whether environmental variability is associated with differences in male and female pre-breeding foraging niche.
