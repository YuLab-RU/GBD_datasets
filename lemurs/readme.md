# Lemurs

> ### About Lemurs and the Duke Lemur Center

> The [Duke Lemur Center](https://lemur.duke.edu/) houses over 200
> lemurs across 14 species – the most diverse population of lemurs on
> Earth, outside their native Madagascar.
>
> Lemurs are the most threatened group of mammals on the planet, and 95%
> of lemur species are at risk of extinction. Our mission is to learn
> everything we can about lemurs – because the more we learn, the better
> we can work to save them from extinction. They are endemic only to
> Madagascar, so it's essentially a one-shot deal: once lemurs are gone
> from Madagascar, they are gone from the wild.
>
> By studying the variables that most affect their health, reproduction,
> and social dynamics, the Duke Lemur Center learns how to most
> effectively focus [their conservation
> efforts](https://lemur.duke.edu/protect/overview-madagascar-conservation-programs/).
> And the more we learn about lemurs, the better we can educate the
> public around the world about just how amazing these animals are, why
> they need to be protected, and how each and every one of us can make a
> difference in their survival.

> ### Taxonomic Code

> A separate table is provided for the taxonomic code.
